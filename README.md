If you experience trouble while install `pyaudio`, install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and do the following:

brew update
brew install portaudio
brew link --overwrite portaudio
```

In the repo directory, run the following in your terminal:
```

```
###### Note: Avoid using the terminal in your IDE, as it may not have microphone access.
